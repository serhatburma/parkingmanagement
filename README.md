A parking management system is a technology that helps people, companies, and organizations to manage their parking spaces. 
It has four components: payment method, enforcement options, access controls, and reporting. 
The system aims to improve the efficiency, convenience, and security of parking operations, as well as to reduce costs, emissions, and congestion.
